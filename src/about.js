        <div className='value-content'>
          <p>
            On a daily-basis we all experience issues in responding to growing
            customer demands. Decisions are often myopic and most of the time
            those are NOT based on curated data and insights. We are surrounded
            with plenty of data (structured, unstructured), information,
            reports, enterprise tools, but those may not be useful, accessible
            to enable us to take quick and better decisions. Often data is not
            reliable and complete. Same experience is at various levels within
            the organization from bottom to top, across functions and business
            units.
          </p>
          <p>
            We miss early alerts on delivery issues landing us into constant
            fire-fighting situation, leaving no time for us to think, to
            innovate, to take proactive steps, to plan for mitigation. We miss
            early alerts on customer dissatisfaction leading to escalations,
            customer dissatisfaction, customer churn. We miss to sense changes
            in customer behavior, technology disruptions, impacting market-share
            and threat to the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our decisions based on intuition and improper data may be leading to
            high cost of operations, lower cash-flow, high inventory cost,
            increased customer churn and employee attrition.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Bizino, we have done extensive research & development on
            potential structural & sustainable solutions to similar pain areas
            founders experienced over past 2.5 decades, while working for large
            global & domestic companies in diverse industries. Bizino has done
            significant investments in setting up an “Advanced Analytics & AI-ML
            Innovation Lab” focusing on extracting value from data,
            insights-driven decision making, trade-off analysis, raising early
            alerts, designing new metrics, simulating complexity & future
            scenarios. We have built state-of-the-art knowledge base and library
            comprised of advanced tool-kits, techniques, algorithms, practices &
            POCs at our disposal, which enable us to provide right-fit solution
